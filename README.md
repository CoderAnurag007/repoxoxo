# For Tanu ❤️ — A Digital Love Story

A romantic, animated single-page experience built with Next.js.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Optional: background music

To enable the music toggle, add an MP3 file at:

**`public/romantic-music.mp3`**

If the file is missing, the toggle still appears but playback will not start (no error).

## Replace memory images

Edit `src/components/MemoriesSection.tsx` and replace the `PLACEHOLDER_IMAGES` array with your own image URLs (e.g. from your project or a CDN). Use 10 image URLs for the "Some Beautiful Memories" grid.

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

— Made with love 💖
